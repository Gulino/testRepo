  <p> This statue was excavated illegally by some local tomb riders in 1977 close to the ruins of the fifth- to first-century BC town of Morgantina, in Sicily  it was  purposefully broken into three parts and hidden in a truck which contained carrots,  in order to facilitate its illegal transport from Italy to Switzerland. There, the swiss resident Renzo Canavesi sold it to the London dealer Robin Symes for 400.000 dollars. In 1986, Symes sold the statue to the Paul Getty Museum of Los Angles for $18 million, saying that it had formerly belonged to a supermarket magnate and collector in Chiasso, Switzerland.

By that time Italian carabinieri started the investigations, focus on pictures found in a caveau in Switzerland, showing the statue in pieces before its restoration. In 2001, the Court of Enna sentenced Renzo Canavesi, to 2 years’ imprisonment and to pay a penalty of 40 billion lire. This was the first case in Italy, where a court applied such a penalty for the illegal export of works of  art. In 2006, in view of the evidence put together during the investigation, the Getty agreed to return the Aphrodite to Italy. The statue arrived back in Italy in  2010 and in March 2011 it was installed in the museum of Aidone, the town closest to Morgantina, during the celebration of the 150 anniversary of Italian Unity.

In 2006, Jason Felch and Ralph Frammolino, two journalists from the Los Angeles Times became finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for exposing the role of the J. Paul Getty Museum and other American museums in the black market for looted antiquities. Their book is called  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1ucfMMxTu0sC&pg=PA371&lpg=PA371&dq=morgantina+venus+frammolino&source=bl&ots=n6-ItncNut&sig=5NSHisMvsITkYgiS8Kht4v29Xfw&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM2auRgtHZAhWRv1MKHaRLDSoQ6AEIeTAO#v=onepage&q=morgantina%20venus%20frammolino&f=false"><i>Chasing Aphrodite, The Hunt for Looted Antiquities at the World’s Richest Museum</i></a> (2011). After years of detective work, the two authors presented their first book about the case, bringing together all elements of that particular criminal network. </p>

  <h1> The Beauty </h1>
  <p> The Getty Aphrodite is a  2.3 m tall limestone and marble statue of a female goddess, dating back 425–400 BC. The creator of the statue was a direct disciple of Phidias, one of the most important sculptor in Greece. Morgantina Goddess is an unique and exceptional example of original Greek sculpture, because of its great size and because of its refined style.
The Museum of Aidone houses, in addition to the Sculpture, two amazing Acroliths, which represent Demeter and Kore. Acrolith means a sculpture made with a particular technique, in which the visible parts of the statue were made of marble, such as the head, feet and hands, the rest of the body was usually made in poor material, such as wood or terracotta. </p>
