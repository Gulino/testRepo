  <h2> A troubled story </h2>
  <p> This is the story of a sculpture with a powerful beauty and an uncertain identity.
    She has been named in many different ways: Morgantina Venus, Getty Aphrodite, and nowadays is best known simply as Morgantina Goddess.
     In the next pages you will know a little more about the thousand-year old, adventurous  life of this extraordinary marble woman but, who is she?
Archeologists and academics still discuss about who this goddess is. The original denomination “Venus” is surely wrong, because nowadays the most confirmed theory see  the sculpture as Demeter. To prove this last theory there is the fact that Enna was the most influential center of the Goddess cult.
Demeter is the goddess of harvest and agriculture, the mother who presides over the natural cycle of seasons on earth. The myth of Demeter and Kore (Cerer and Persephone are the roman equivalent names) is one of the most fascinating in greek mythology <a href="http://www.regione.sicilia.it/beniculturali/deadimorgantina/museoaidone.html">(learn more about the Rape of Persephone)</a>, and according to the legend, it took place in Enna, in the central area of Sicily.
The sculpture is today hosted by the archaelogical museum of Aidone, in the heart of Sicily. Discover about the story of Morgantina goddess in the next page, and if you are planning a trip in Sicily, discovery how to stand in front of this beautiful work of art following the links below! </p>
